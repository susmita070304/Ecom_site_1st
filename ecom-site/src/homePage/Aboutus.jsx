       Welcome to <span className="font-bold"> COMFY </span> Home 🌿<br /> 
         — where passion meets purpose. We started with a simple idea: to make quality products that bring joy to everyday life. From our very first order to today, our goal has always been the same — to create something meaningful, accessible, and beautifully made. Every item in our store is carefully selected or designed with love, care, and attention to detail. We’re a small team with big dreams, and we’re so grateful to have you on this journey with us.
